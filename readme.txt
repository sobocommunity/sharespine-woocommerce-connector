– Pricing details
– Stock value
– Variants & attributes

Data we pull from the Marketplaces:
– Orders
– Customer details
– Settlements (if availiable)


With Plugboard you can also convert and/or differentiate your data. Lets say you want each marketplace to contain different description or images, or some marketplaces do not allow non-numerical SKU:s. With plugboard you can set rules as well as change specific data to specific marketplace(s).
