Premium Synchronizing of customers, products and orders from WooCommerce to Fortnox, Specter, Visma, Mamut, Hogia, CDON, Fyndiq, Tradera, Afound ...

== Description ==
= SHARESPINE PLUGBOARD - MARKETPLACES =
With Sharespine Plugboard you can sell your WooCommerce products on several Nordic and European marketplaces. The Plugboard Integration platform will connect your webshop to the selected marketplace(s) and make sure you always have your WooCommerce and Marketplace data synchronized.

Data we push to the Marketplaces:
 - Product details (descriptions, pictures, SKU)
 - Pricing details
 - Stock value
 - Variants & attributes

Data we pull from the Marketplaces:
 - Orders
 - Customer details

With Plugboard you can also convert and/or differentiate your data. Lets say you want each marketplace to contain different description or images, or lets say some marketplaces do not allow non-numerical SKU:s. With plugboard you can set rules as well as change specific data to specific marketplace(s).

Marketplaces we support at the moment:
 - CDON
 - FYNDIQ
 - Tradera
 - Afound
 - CoolShop
 - VidaXL
More marketplaces will be added soon.

integrated with ERP systems. More details about ERP integrations can
